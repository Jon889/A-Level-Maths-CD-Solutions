A-Level-Maths-CD-Solutions
==========================


Requires
--------

* PHP server (with short tags enabled)
* A Level Maths CDs

Instructions
------------

1. Clone this repository to a server
2. Delete the SEE_README_AND_DELETE_THIS files
3. From each CD copy the solution xml files from to the corresponding directory on the server. 
   For all units except C2 the solution xml files are in the content/sb/content directory (such as c1_ch1.xml) You don't need the ones named as just the unit (such as c1.xml)
   For C2, the directory to copy the xml files from is content/sb/content/c2
4. From each CD copy the images from the content/sb/content/images directory to the images folder on the server. (Yes all the images get mixed in to the one folder)
   Again for C2, the directory is content/sb/content/c2/images
5. Hopefully that's it, create an issue here if you need help.


I'd be grateful if you would leave the right side menu in :)
